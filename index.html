Movies
Breakout Role in 'The Impossible'
Not long after hanging up his dance shoes for Billy Elliot, Holland was tapped to voice the character of Sho for the British version of the animated The Secret World of Arrietty (2010). However, it was his performance in The Impossible (2012) that firmly established him as one of the industry's promising young talents. Based on a true account of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, Holland shined as an adolescent who tends to his injured mother (Naomi Watts) as he searches for his missing father (Ewan McGregor), garnering an array of award nominations.

How Old Was Holland When He Played in 'The Impossible'?
Holland was 13 when he tried out for the role as the eldest son.

Spider-Man
Following a turn in the drama How I Live Now (2013), Holland landed a supporting part in the 2015 BBC historical miniseries Wolf Hall. Shortly afterward, his path to global stardom was launched with the announcement that he would take over the role of Peter Parker for the latest reboot of Spider-Man. Unlike his predecessors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, who were in their mid-to-late 20s when tapped for Spidey, the 19-year-old Holland was much closer in age to Peter Parker's troubled high school student turned superhero.

'Spider-Man: Homecoming' and 'Far From Home'
In the spring of 2016, Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War. Despite limited screen time, he drew strong reviews for his version of the iconic web slinger, paving the way for his anticipated — and well received — performance in 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming. Holland then reprised his superhero role in the ensemble blockbusters Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), before adding the next chapter to his character's story with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).

'In the Heart of the Sea,' 'The Lost City of Z'
Meanwhile, Holland had other acting obligations to fulfill. The epic In the Heart of the Sea (2015) was a box-office flop, but it provided another showcase for the burgeoning star, as well as the chance to test his mettle amid difficult shooting conditions. He then featured prominently in 2016's Edge of Winter and The Lost City of Z, before starring in the medieval action drama Pilgrimage (2017).

'Spies in Disguise,' 'Dolittle'
In late 2019, Holland teamed up with Will Smith for the animated adventure Spies in Disguise. He then voiced the character of Jip the dog in the star-studded Dolittle (2020), before preparing for another leading voice role in Pixar's Onward.

Upcoming Movies
Among his upcoming projects, Holland will be starring in Chaos Walking (a film adaptation of the YA series by Patrick Ness) and the psychological horror flick The Devil All the Time.

Personal Life
Holland has attended the Donhead Preparatory School, Wimbledon College and the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in England. His brother Harry has followed with success in acting, nabbing the part of Prince Harry of Wales for the 2013 drama Diana.

An enthusiastic social media user, Holland has drawn attention for posts that feature his impressive acrobatic moves and boxing skills, as well as his pit bull, Tessa.

Early Years and 'Billy Elliot'
Thomas Stanley Holland was born on June 1, 1996, in Kingston-upon-Thames, England. The oldest of four boys, he was born into an artistic family: Mom Nicola is a photographer, and dad Dominic is a stand-up comedian and an author.

Holland began attending hip-hop dance classes at the Nifty Feet Dance Studio, whose owner, Lynne Page, helped choreograph the hit movie Billy Elliot (2000). After Holland's class performed at the 2006 Richmond Dance Festival, Page was convinced to send her pupil to audition for Billy Elliot the Musical.

With no formal training in ballet or drama, Holland failed to impress most of the talent evaluators at the audition. However, he did impress Billy Elliot director Stephen Daldry, who loved Holland's natural performing ability and stage presence.

Following two years of ballet lessons, Holland debuted with the West End production in June 2008 as Billy's best friend, Michael. He soon slid into the starring role, and wowed audiences with his acrobatic ability until his final performance in May 2010.
